# 👋 Hi there, I'm Marsad Irfan

🎓 *Computer Scientist* | 🤖 *AI Enthusiast* | ⚙️ *Professional & Academic Explorer*

---

I'm a computer scientist with a deep interest in **artificial intelligence**, **software systems**, and **elegant problem-solving**. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, and I believe that the future lies in building tools that are both intelligent and efficient.

### 🧠 Areas of Interest:
- 🐍 **Python**, 💻 **C / C++**, 🌐 **JavaScript**
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
- ⚙️ **System Design, Algorithms, and Clean Code**
- 📚 **Open-Ended Learning and Research-Oriented Thinking**

Though I’m early in my open-source journey, I aim to build **high-quality**, **well-documented**, and **purpose-driven** tools — especially in the AI and systems domains.

## 🚀 My Current Goals

- Build open-source tools that blend AI with real-world utility
- Explore systems programming and efficient architectures
- Keep learning & contributing to meaningful tech communities
